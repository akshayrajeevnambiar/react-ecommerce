# Modern Full Stack ECommerce Application with Stripe & Sanity eCommerce

Welcome to the Modern Full Stack ECommerce Application project! I'm thrilled to introduce you to this project, which I built to get some experience with the buiding using Next.js and working with stripe and CMS sytems.

## Project Overview:

This project is all about building and deploying a fully responsive Modern Full Stack Ecommerce application with Payments functionality. It's designed with modern design principles, engaging animations, and most importantly, the ability to handle real payments through Stripe integration (Feature build still in progress).

## Learning Objectives:

Throughout this project, I aimed to cover a wide range of topics to enhance my skills in:

- **Advanced React Best Practices:** Dive into folder and file structure organization, explore hooks and refs, and master advanced state management using React Context API.
- **Next.js Best Practices:** Learn file-based routing, data fetching for server-side rendering and static generation, and leverage Next.js as a backend endpoint for enhanced performance.

## Features yet in progress:

- **Integration with Stripe:** Explore how to manage payments, products, shipping rates, and the entire checkout process seamlessly using Stripe.
- **Content Management with Sanity:** Discover how to manage the entire content of the application using Sanity, allowing for instant updates and changes to products and store information.
- **Next.js Backend Endpoint:** Enhance performance and optimization with Next.js.
